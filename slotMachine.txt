How to use:
You must start off when using the GUI by adding 0.75$ using the button until you reach whatever value you desire. You then must 
select the target value that you would like to try to match by using the left and right arrows to pick a value between 1 and 10.
After you have done that, you then must pay the machine to pull the lever(honor code). When you pull the lever, a window will pull up
notifying you that you may now pull the lever. You will have to keep adding money and pulling the lever until the random number matches with
the target number that you selected. When you finally match the number, you will recieve a message at the bottom saying
"congratulations" and will give a happy little smiley face.
